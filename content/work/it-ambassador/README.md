IT Ambassador 2017 was an event in my faculty for voting student ambassadors of the freshman year 2017.
I, in my sophomore year, was invited to film its promotional video
along with other colleagues who performed promotional photoshoots.

> The video has been viewed almost ten thousand times and shared over 160 places.

The video was shot entirely on a single DSLR camera.

**Roles:**

- Director
- Cinematographer
